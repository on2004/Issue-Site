        <h2>Causes of Overpopulation</h2>
        <p>Overpopulation is driven by reduced mortality rates, advances in fertility treatments, and lack of family planning. These factors create pressure on natural resources and contribute to environmental degradation.</p>
        <h2>Effects of Overpopulation</h2>
        <p>Overpopulation causes issues such as urban overcrowding, pollution, resource depletion, and food insecurity. We need to tackle these problems by raising awareness and developing sustainable solutions.</p>
